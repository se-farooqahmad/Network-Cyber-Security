## Projects

### Project 1 – Implementing Authentication and Access Control

A demonstration of secure authentication mechanisms, session management, and access control implementation for web applications.  
Key topics covered:  
* User authentication workflows  
* Role-based access control  
* Security best practices

### Project 2 – CSRF & XSS Attacks

Practical exploration of web application vulnerabilities:  
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (both stored and reflected)

Each example includes exploitation demonstration and mitigation strategies.

### Project 3 – Buffer Overflow and Stack Protections

This project demonstrates classic memory corruption vulnerabilities:  
* Exploiting buffer overflows  
* Techniques for bypassing modern stack protections (e.g., stack canaries, DEP/ASLR)

Includes code examples and exploitation walkthroughs.

### Project 4 – RSA Cryptosystem

An implementation and explanation of the RSA public-key cryptosystem.  
Topics covered:  
* Key generation  
* Encryption & decryption algorithms  
* Security rationale

## Getting Started

To run or explore the projects locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/se-farooqahmad/Network-Cyber-Security.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder you want to explore.

3. Follow the instructions in the individual project folders (each should include a `README.md` with setup details).

## Prerequisites

Depending on the project, prerequisites may include:

* Python 3.x
* GCC / Make (for C projects)
* A modern web browser (for web app security demos)
* Optional: Virtual machines or containers for safe vulnerability testing

## Usage

Each project folder should contain usage instructions, example commands, or code snippets demonstrating how to build, run, or test the project.
